# react-portfolio

# Description
This project consisted in the creation of a polished portfolio to demostrate the work I have been performing during the last 6 months. 
I enjoyed doing this project because it helped me to strengthen the skills I have learned about developing single web applications with React. 

When the portfolio website is loaded, the user will see the "About Me" section where a navigation bar is displayed with the name of the different components of he website. 

In the footer the user can click on the icons of the different platforms where I am at (GitHub, LinkedIn and StackOverflow).

In the "Portfolio" section, the user can see the title of some of my projects, with an image and button that will take it to the GitHub repository and deployed website when applicable.

In the "Contact" section, the user can fill out a form to provide its name, email and message.

Finally, in the "Resume" section, the user can see a table that contains my technical skills and a link to download my resume if desired.
