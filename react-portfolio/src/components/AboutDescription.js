        <p>I am Dina Brady. I am originary from Mexico and I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Certification at the University of Utah. </p>
        <p>I have a bachelor's degree in International Relations by the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas,
        the state where I am from. I have experience working in the diplomatic and legal fields after I worked as a consular officer for 8 years at the Mexican
        Consulate in Salt Lake City, Utah, and as an immigration paralegal for almost 4 years. After all the valuable experience I have gained, 
        I decided to apply my skills in a field where I could implement them in a more creative way and contribute at a higher scale by creating applications that will produce
        a positive impact in people's lives. I want to be part of solutions to help people and organizations to fulfill their goals!.
